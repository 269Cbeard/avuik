Lovely & happily crafted by Diego Martín Lafuente.

**AVUIK** is a complete, public domain licensed, illustration set of the latest Android Universal Interface theme called Holo, wich is available on Android Kit Kat and that you can use freely on Sketch App.

I developed this project to design the awesome Notegraphy.com app for Android.

Android is a Google trademark and I don't have any relationship with the company, though I would love to work for it :). This is a base artwork to design awesome Android apps.

## Philosophy

The project is presented in several artboards in order to divide different examples of the original UI work and make it easy to use by copy/paste system in other Sketch app documents instead browsing several hidden groups and layers. They're designed using real _dp_ and they're not re-scaled.

The size of the artboard used (wich represents the real viewport of the phone) fits _perfectamente_ in a Nexus 5 terminal: 1080×1920. The principal orientation _is portrait_. I don't deny to design the landscape options for future commits as well to prepare the Nexus 7 or other tablets options.

## Recomendations

1. Make a new Sketch app document.
2. Create an art board with 1080×1920 and replicate it many times.
3. Use this master file and never modify it. Just copy and paste the group.
4. Hide what you don't use, it will be useful if you change your mind later.
5. You can re-style practically all the items.

## Future development

I wish to start these ones:

1. Android Nexus 7 & 10 dimensions UI set.
2. iOS 7.2 complete UI set
3. Windows Phone

Any donation will be really welcome (paypal to dlafuente@gmail.com), it will help to buy the devices to test the artwork until they're correctomundo.

I also can design/prototype your future app.

Have a lot of fun and profit. Don't hesitate to contact me to show your finished artwork. I would love to see the results.
